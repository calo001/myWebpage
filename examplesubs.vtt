(Male announcer)
Previously, on Hell's Kitchen...

3
00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:06.254
18 chefs from all over America

4
00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:08.023
came to compete for
the biggest prize

5
00:00:08.024 --> 00:00:09.524
in Hell's Kitchen history.

6
00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:11.326
This year, I'm looking

7
00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:12.928
for my head chef,

8
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.597
[gasps]
at Gordon Ramsay's Steak

9
00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:17.299
at the Paris in Las Vegas.

10
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.067
(Announcer)
At the signature dish challenge,

11
00:00:19.068 --> 00:00:21.536
Dana, Royce and Robyn
stood out.

12
00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:23.405
That's delicious.
Thank you, chef.

13
00:00:23.406 --> 00:00:25.407
He loved it. That's like
the best orgasm ever.

14
00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.542
(Announcer)
While Tavon, Don and Guy...

15
00:00:27.543 --> 00:00:28.543
It's not for eating.

16
00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:29.678
[Coughs]

17
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.079
(Announcer)
All failed to impress.

18
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.514
And when it came down

19
00:00:32.515 --> 00:00:34.216
to the final two
dishes on the table,

20
00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.885
it was the chef de cuisine
from Philly, Christina...

21
00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:38.987
Amazing. The women
have the challenge.

22
00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.156
(Announcer) Who clinched
the victory for the women.

23
00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:42.724
Yay! We won!

24
00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:44.392
(Announcer) At the opening
night's dinner service,

25
00:00:44.393 --> 00:00:45.560
Christina quickly...

26
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:47.062
Oh, my God.

27
00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:48.763
(Announcer) Fell out of
chef Ramsay's good graces.

28
00:00:48.764 --> 00:00:49.965
What in the [bleep] is that?

29
00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.500
(Christina) I'm sorry that
I couldn't come through.

30
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.702
(Announcer)
Also, in the red kitchen...

31
00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:54.936
Scallops!
Yeah.

32
00:00:54.937 --> 00:00:55.937
(Announcer) Roshni...

33
00:00:55.938 --> 00:00:57.105
Ready, chef.
Come here.

34
00:00:57.106 --> 00:00:58.573
Just touch these.

35
00:00:58.574 --> 00:00:59.708
(Announcer)
Struggled with the scallops.

36
00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:00.242
They're overcooked.

37
00:01:00.243 --> 00:01:01.243
I screwed up.

38
00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:03.678
I've cooked scallops
millions of times.

39
00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:05.046
(Announcer) On the blue team...

40
00:01:05.047 --> 00:01:06.281
What the [bleep] have you done?

41
00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:07.716
(Announcer)
Tavon butchered the scallops.

42
00:01:07.717 --> 00:01:09.050
Look.

43
00:01:13.022 --> 00:01:15.156
Stop! This [bleeping] pigeon's
that raw it can still fly.

44
00:01:15.157 --> 00:01:16.157
[Bleep] off upstairs.

45
00:01:16.158 --> 00:01:17.158
Get out!

46
00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.693
Tavon couldn't cook a squab.

47
00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:20.228
Like, he's just
a [bleeping] moron.

48
00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:21.863
(Announcer) But Royce
didn't fare any better.

49
00:01:21.864 --> 00:01:23.031
(Royce) Anybody know
where anchovies are?

50
00:01:23.032 --> 00:01:24.399
Got to get some appetizers out!

51
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.600
(Royce) Guy was at the station.

52
00:01:25.601 --> 00:01:27.202
I was ambushed 100%.

53
00:01:27.203 --> 00:01:29.137
Get out!
[Bleep] off.

54
00:01:29.138 --> 00:01:31.139
(Announcer) After an embarrassing
first dinner service...

55
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.108
The blue team, you sucked.

56
00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:35.677
At least the red kitchen
completed the appetizers.

57
00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:37.212
(Announcer) The men lost.

58
00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:39.147
Anybody who was on that line

59
00:01:39.148 --> 00:01:41.116
that wasn't embarrassed doesn't
belong anywhere in the kitchen.

60
00:01:41.117 --> 00:01:42.517
(Announcer) At elimination,
they nominated...

61
00:01:42.518 --> 00:01:43.818
Tavon.
(Announcer) And...

62
00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.020
Don.

63
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:46.588
(Announcer) But chef Ramsay...

64
00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:47.756
Don? Why?
He didn't even cook.

65
00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:48.590
(Announcer)
Had a nominee of his own.

66
00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:49.658
Royce.

67
00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.126
Step forward.

68
00:01:51.127 --> 00:01:52.927
(Announcer)
Forcing Royce to defend himself.

69
00:01:52.928 --> 00:01:54.496
I felt sabotaged, by Guy.

70
00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:55.797
(Announcer)
In the end, it was...

71
00:01:55.798 --> 00:01:57.032
Tavon.

72
00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:59.659
(Announcer)
Who saw his dream extinguished.

(Guy) Royce, he goes up there
in front of chef Ramsay

97
00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.615
and throws me under the bus,
right? That's how you say it?

what the [bleep] you did.

The only thing that
I've been worried about so far

107
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:42.804
is being a team.

108
00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:47.108
(Announcer) And the red team
not faring much better,

109
00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.844
chef Ramsay sends
a wake-up call

110
00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:55.483

Let's go. Quick.

Last night I witnessed

125
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:31.986
one of the worst performances
of scallops ever.

Embarrassing.

00:04:37.693 --> 00:04:40.762
I got a hold of a supplier
early hours this morning,

130
00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:43.131
and I told him
to make a delivery.

131
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.341
That was the last thing
I expected to see.

132
00:04:53.342 --> 00:04:55.076
This ain't fun and games.

133
00:04:55.077 --> 00:04:57.145
(Gordon) There are 125 scallops

134
00:04:57.146 --> 00:04:59.013
in each mound of ice.

135
00:04:59.014 --> 00:05:02.150
We see these two huge mounds
of ice, with seaweed, and like,

136
00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:03.785
ice was freezing.

scallops like a dog.

00:06:10.085 --> 00:06:11.586
I'm ready for it, I got it.

179
00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:13.087
Let's do it.

180
00:06:13.088 --> 00:06:14.923
Let's not [bleeping] lose today.
Let's not, honestly.

181
00:06:14.924 --> 00:06:15.957
Girls, watch out, we're coming.

182
00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:19.527
Blue team is here,
and we're ready to go.

183
00:06:19.528 --> 00:06:21.729
Your challenge this
morning will be

184
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.166
to shuck, clean, and cook

185
00:06:25.167 --> 00:06:28.469
as many properly-cooked orders
of scallops

186
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:29.504
as you can. Got it?

187
00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:31.873
(All) Yes, chef.
Good.

188
00:06:31.874 --> 00:06:33.908
First, I'm going to show you
how to shuck and clean.

189
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:34.842
Watch carefully.
Take your bread knife,

190
00:06:34.843 --> 00:06:36.544
in and twist.

191
00:06:36.545 --> 00:06:39.013
From there...

192
00:06:39.014 --> 00:06:40.648
I never, ever in my life,

193
00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:42.817
opened a scallop.
Never.

194
00:06:42.818 --> 00:06:44.519
No experience with scallops.

195
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.554
Thumb runs down the side
of the scallop.

196
00:06:46.555 --> 00:06:49.223
Carefully, it pries it out.

197
00:06:49.224 --> 00:06:52.527
It's just nasty,
and it's disgusting.

198
00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:54.495
But yet, if you want to win
this competition,

199
00:06:54.496 --> 00:06:55.496
you've got to get in there
and get dirty.

200
00:06:55.497 --> 00:07:00.001
I want each and every dish
looking like this.

201
00:07:00.002 --> 00:07:03.638
How, exactly, we should have
served them last night.

202
00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.940
They're sliced evenly,
they're cooked evenly.

203
00:07:05.941 --> 00:07:09.944
We've got the flat sides of the
scallop in towards the salad.

204
00:07:09.945 --> 00:07:11.613
The first team to cook six

205
00:07:11.614 --> 00:07:13.915
stunning scallop dishes
wins the challenge.

206
00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:16.351
You'll be working in pairs.

207
00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:17.819
Are you ready?
(All) Yes, chef.

208
00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:18.653
You challenge starts...

209
00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:20.588
Now.
Let's go.

210
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:22.890
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay has
selected this challenge

211
00:07:22.891 --> 00:07:25.960
to get the chefs focused on
their attention to detail.

212
00:07:25.961 --> 00:07:27.929
The first team
to produce six orders

213
00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:30.531
that meet chef Ramsay's
exacting standards will win.

214
00:07:30.532 --> 00:07:32.934
This scallop is a sexy bitch.

215
00:07:32.935 --> 00:07:36.204
He wants perfection,
let's just give him perfection.

216
00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:38.606
Get perfect plates
up to that pass.

217
00:07:38.607 --> 00:07:41.709
(Announcer) While the women work
carefully to achieve perfection...

218
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.778
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
We gotta go, together.

219
00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:45.346
Let's put some of those
beautiful greens up top.

220
00:07:45.347 --> 00:07:48.149
Go, go, go, go, go.
(Announcer) The men are focused on...

221
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.586
Getting dishes to chef Ramsay
as fast as possible.

222
00:07:51.587 --> 00:07:53.054
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

223
00:07:53.055 --> 00:07:54.055
All right, come on!

224
00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:55.890
Ring the bell.
Oh, [bleep].

225
00:07:55.891 --> 00:07:58.860
Ring the bell.
Come here, you muppet.

226
00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:00.928
Who put them on the plate?
Look at mine.

227
00:08:00.929 --> 00:08:02.296
What did I say?

228
00:08:02.297 --> 00:08:04.465
Round side out.
Flat side towards the salad.

229
00:08:04.466 --> 00:08:07.602
Round side out, flat side in.
Start again!

230
00:08:07.603 --> 00:08:09.404
Oh, [bleep].
This is going to be

231
00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:10.672
a little [bleeping]
tougher than I thought.

232
00:08:10.673 --> 00:08:12.340
Ah, I cut that one.

233
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:13.508
Come on, we can do this, guys,

234
00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:14.509
we can do this.

235
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:16.177
Let's walk.

236
00:08:16.178 --> 00:08:17.629
(Gordon) Let's go, I'm
not touching anything

237
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.781
until you ring the bell.
[Bell rings] No, the plate's not done.

238
00:08:19.782 --> 00:08:20.848
Down, you have to wait.

239
00:08:20.849 --> 00:08:22.717
Done?
Let's go, they were first.

240
00:08:22.718 --> 00:08:25.720
Scallops, one, two, three, four,
five. Bearnaise, done.

241
00:08:25.721 --> 00:08:30.191
Scallop? Beautifully cooked.
Great job, well done.

242
00:08:30.192 --> 00:08:32.360
Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.

243
00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:33.795
One point for the red.
Great job.

244
00:08:33.796 --> 00:08:35.196
Come on, let's do it again.

245
00:08:35.197 --> 00:08:37.131
Tiffany and I are starting
to hit our stride.

246
00:08:37.132 --> 00:08:40.435
We know what we just did.
And all we have to do is repeat.

247
00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:42.470
The problem I've got
with that...

248
00:08:42.471 --> 00:08:44.072
One big scallop,
one small scallop.

249
00:08:44.073 --> 00:08:45.573
I want five scallops
all the same!

250
00:08:45.574 --> 00:08:48.209
Yes, chef.
Come on!

251
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:52.213
One, two, three, four, five.

252
00:08:52.214 --> 00:08:54.082
Nicely served.
Well done. Good job.

253
00:08:54.083 --> 00:08:56.617
Come on, girls!
We got two, ladies, we got two.

254
00:08:56.618 --> 00:08:58.653
I'm like, "boom
goes the [bleep] dynamite!"

255
00:08:58.654 --> 00:08:59.754
We got this!

256
00:08:59.755 --> 00:09:01.322
All right, guys, look at me.

257
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:03.624
Speed up a bit, will you,
please, yes? Let's go.

258
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:06.060
[Bleep]! I'm moving around, and
we got nothing in the window.

259
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:07.528
I just gotta go for it because

260
00:09:07.529 --> 00:09:09.197
we're not moving along
at this point.

261
00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:12.700
Who cooked that? Look,
it's a rectangle scallop.

262
00:09:12.701 --> 00:09:14.936
And look.
Any rectangle scallops there?

263
00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:18.906
One missing this.
Start again! [bleep]!

264
00:09:18.907 --> 00:09:20.608
They didn't even get one
yet, guys.

265
00:09:20.609 --> 00:09:21.909
They didn't even get one
yet, guys!

266
00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.845
(Announcer)
While the men struggle

267
00:09:23.846 --> 00:09:25.947
to complete even one dish...
Come on, get that up!

268
00:09:25.948 --> 00:09:27.849
(Announcer)
The women get point...

269
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:30.184
Good job.
(Announcer) After point...

270
00:09:30.185 --> 00:09:32.553
Beautifully done.
(Announcer) After point.

271
00:09:32.554 --> 00:09:35.156
Well done.
[lndistinct shouting]

272
00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:37.058
Ladies, one.
Ladies, one.

273
00:09:37.059 --> 00:09:39.627
Men, ehhh!
Men, ehhh!

274
00:09:39.628 --> 00:09:40.695
You suck.

275
00:09:40.696 --> 00:09:42.396
Come on, guys.
Go, go, go, go.

276
00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:44.098
They've got five points,
and we've got nothing.

277
00:09:44.099 --> 00:09:46.134
I mean, we gotta push it.

278
00:09:46.135 --> 00:09:49.504
(Announcer) With the women needing
only one more dish for victory,

279
00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:52.406
the men need a miracle to catch up.
Let's do it.

280
00:09:52.407 --> 00:09:54.041
(Announcer) But right now
they'll have to settle

281
00:09:54.042 --> 00:09:55.276
for Guy and Royce.

282
00:09:55.277 --> 00:09:57.245
Don't put it up there.
It's not even there yet.

283
00:09:57.246 --> 00:09:59.280
Always show the [bleep] boss.
Square side in.

284
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:01.549
Beautifully cooked.
Lovely sear.

285
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:03.785
Stunning. Well done. Good job.
(Both) Thank you, chef.

286
00:10:03.786 --> 00:10:05.353
Let's go, baby! Let's go!

287
00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:07.922
A stunning, stunning dish.
Well done, Guy.

288
00:10:07.923 --> 00:10:10.191
Thank you very much.
Royce, well done. Let's go.

289
00:10:10.192 --> 00:10:11.726
Flat side in.
Flat side in.

290
00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:13.161
Want me to put
the flat side in?

291
00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:14.796
Flat side in.

292
00:10:14.797 --> 00:10:16.364
Who cooked the scallops?
I did, chef.

293
00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:19.300
Solid done.
Beautifully done.

294
00:10:19.301 --> 00:10:21.202
Beautifully done. Good job.
Really good job.

295
00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.104
Hurry up! Let's go.
Let's get another one.

296
00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:24.972
Push through, guys, push
through. Let's get this done!

297
00:10:24.973 --> 00:10:26.808
I got a plate.
We're ready to go.

298
00:10:26.809 --> 00:10:28.509
Let's go, ladies.
They guys are pulling it back.

299
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:30.378
Let's go.
We gotta win this.

300
00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:32.046
We have to win this challenge.

301
00:10:32.047 --> 00:10:33.748
There's a lot of [bleep]
pressure right now.

302
00:10:33.749 --> 00:10:36.584
I've got all different sizes.
Look. Come here.

303
00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:38.653
There's mommy, there's daddy,
there's the daughter,

304
00:10:38.654 --> 00:10:40.121
there's the son,
and there's the baby.

305
00:10:40.122 --> 00:10:41.088
[Bleep] off.
What's the matter with you?

306
00:10:41.089 --> 00:10:42.590
Come on, ladies, .

307
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:44.659
We only need one more point.
One more point.

308
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.494
Guy, feel these.
He's gonna send these back.

309
00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:48.429
Feel it. Feel it.
Send 'em back.

310
00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:51.132
Come on, guys, come on.
Plate that.

311
00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:53.601
This is it.

312
00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:56.304
Please, let it be perfect.

313
00:10:57.873 --> 00:11:00.007
(Gordon) Who cooked that?

314
00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.345
(Announcer) In the attention-to-detail
scallop challenge,

315
00:11:05.346 --> 00:11:07.280
the women are ahead 5-2.

316
00:11:07.281 --> 00:11:10.016
This is it.
(Announcer) And Barbie and Tiffany

317
00:11:10.017 --> 00:11:12.152
have a chance to clinch it
for their team.

318
00:11:12.153 --> 00:11:14.054
Who cooked those scallops?
I did, chef.

319
00:11:14.055 --> 00:11:16.556
They're cooked stunningly.

320
00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:18.391
Ladies, congratulations.

321
00:11:18.392 --> 00:11:21.594
[Women cheering]

322
00:11:21.595 --> 00:11:24.497
I just put up
three perfect scallops,

323
00:11:24.498 --> 00:11:25.832
and we won!

324
00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:27.367
I just rocked it out.

325
00:11:27.368 --> 00:11:30.170
[Bleep] me!

326
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:31.504
If it's a close battle,

327
00:11:31.505 --> 00:11:33.907
I could accept
that sort of loss.

328
00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:36.776
But it was a blowout.
It's embarrassing.

329
00:11:36.777 --> 00:11:40.313
[Cheering]

330
00:11:40.314 --> 00:11:42.916
Ladies, well done.
Thank you, chef.

331
00:11:42.917 --> 00:11:44.384
Yeah!
Sorry, guys.

332
00:11:44.385 --> 00:11:48.421
I'm not sorry.
We worked hard.

333
00:11:48.422 --> 00:11:50.724
Now, for winning
today's challenge,

334
00:11:50.725 --> 00:11:53.093
you'll be joining me...

335
00:11:53.094 --> 00:11:56.162
on a trip to the stunning,

336
00:11:56.163 --> 00:11:58.365
beautiful island of Catalina.

337
00:11:58.366 --> 00:12:00.266
[Women shouting]

338
00:12:00.267 --> 00:12:06.706
I've also got a stunning yacht
to get us there.

339
00:12:06.707 --> 00:12:08.341
Oh, my God!

340
00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:10.877
I don't have a passport.
You don't need one.

341
00:12:10.878 --> 00:12:12.779
I knew it was gonna be
something great,

342
00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:14.447
but Catalina and a yacht?
I mean, come on.

343
00:12:14.448 --> 00:12:16.082
Head up to the dorms,
get changed,

344
00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:17.517
and don't forget
your sunscreen.

345
00:12:17.518 --> 00:12:19.719
Well done. Get out of here.
Anybody get seasick?

346
00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.921
Because it's kind rocky
out there.

347
00:12:21.922 --> 00:12:24.190
Wow.

348
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:29.696
Guys, you are in
for a crap day.

349
00:12:29.697 --> 00:12:31.564
I want you
to clean the mess outside.

350
00:12:31.565 --> 00:12:32.999
That's our entrance
to Hell's Kitchen.

351
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.735
I want it pristine.

352
00:12:35.736 --> 00:12:37.303
And if that's not enough,

353
00:12:37.304 --> 00:12:39.005
I need you to do
some heavy duty prep.

354
00:12:39.006 --> 00:12:41.708
I've got some amazing
prawns arriving.

355
00:12:41.709 --> 00:12:45.845
I want them shelled,
cleaned, and de-veined.

356
00:12:45.846 --> 00:12:47.080
Start cleaning up now.

357
00:12:47.081 --> 00:12:48.782
Embarrassing.

358
00:12:48.783 --> 00:12:50.717
Losing sucks.

359
00:12:50.718 --> 00:12:53.420
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna keep losing

360
00:12:53.421 --> 00:12:55.922
with a bunch of, you know,
half-assed jabronis

361
00:12:55.923 --> 00:12:58.725
not pulling their own weight.

362
00:12:58.726 --> 00:13:01.261
Whew! I'd say four people
take one side,

363
00:13:01.262 --> 00:13:02.562
five people take the other.
No?

364
00:13:07.568 --> 00:13:11.371
It's a lot [bleep] bigger
than it looks, man.

365
00:13:11.372 --> 00:13:14.674
Oh, it's like a little piece
of Vermont right out here.

366
00:13:14.675 --> 00:13:16.876
See ya.
We're gonna have a great day.

367
00:13:16.877 --> 00:13:18.378
You guys are gonna have
a [bleep] day.

368
00:13:18.379 --> 00:13:20.747
Bye, guys.
Suck it.

369
00:13:20.748 --> 00:13:23.016
It wasn't even that hard
of a challenge to win.

370
00:13:23.017 --> 00:13:24.951
Bye-bye.

371
00:13:24.952 --> 00:13:26.719
[Bleep].

372
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.455
We got a lot of [bleep] to do.

373
00:13:28.456 --> 00:13:30.457
This is a good enough reason
to win a challenge.

374
00:13:30.458 --> 00:13:31.858
(Announcer) While the men are
on ice and seaweed duty...

375
00:13:31.859 --> 00:13:35.862
How is there still more
[bleep] ice?

376
00:13:35.863 --> 00:13:38.498
(Announcer) The women are
heading to the high seas.

377
00:13:38.499 --> 00:13:40.733
(Gordon) Well done.
Well done, well done, well done, well done.

378
00:13:40.734 --> 00:13:43.870
Now, it's hot out here.
Sip it slowly.

379
00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:47.340
Chef Ramsay, outside the
kitchen, is a cool cat.

380
00:13:47.341 --> 00:13:49.342
How good is it to get out?

381
00:13:49.343 --> 00:13:51.110
This is the first time away
from my fiance,

382
00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:52.946
so I'm a little bit homesick.

383
00:13:52.947 --> 00:13:55.381
Robyn, this is our opportunity
to pick chef Ramsay's brain,

384
00:13:55.382 --> 00:13:57.550
and you want to talk about
your girlfriend.

385
00:13:57.551 --> 00:14:00.053
Why do I have to hear you
chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp?

386
00:14:00.054 --> 00:14:05.425
Look. Dolphins.
Wow.

387
00:14:05.426 --> 00:14:07.460
Treats for you.

388
00:14:07.461 --> 00:14:10.964
Since everybody's so excited
to waste food,

389
00:14:10.965 --> 00:14:12.899
these are all the scallops
that you guys

390
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.834
couldn't cook properly today.

391
00:14:14.835 --> 00:14:18.071
I'll make it nice and smooth
so it goes down easy.

392
00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:22.041
Oh, my God.
Scallop shakes? Ecch!

393
00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:26.312
Ice-cold,
[bleep] three-hour old scallops?

394
00:14:26.313 --> 00:14:28.248
Horrific.
Enjoy.

395
00:14:28.249 --> 00:14:30.016
Thank you, chef.
Thank you, chef.

396
00:14:30.017 --> 00:14:31.684
Up in the middle.

397
00:14:31.685 --> 00:14:33.286
Let's go.
Salud!

398
00:14:33.287 --> 00:14:34.854
Pound it. Let's go.
It's like a protein shake.

399
00:14:34.855 --> 00:14:38.424
Let's drink...
[Bleep].

400
00:14:38.425 --> 00:14:41.060
[Laughter]

401
00:14:41.061 --> 00:14:43.029
Oh, my...

402
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:45.999
Got scallop?
[Laughter]

403
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.167
Get a scallop 'stache.
Ha ha!

404
00:14:48.168 --> 00:14:51.170
We gotta start acting like men.
We're still acting like boys.

405
00:14:51.171 --> 00:14:54.240
Listen, this beverage...

406
00:14:54.241 --> 00:14:56.376
Royce is kind of starting
to piss me off.

407
00:14:56.377 --> 00:14:58.912
I'm not gonna sit there and be
all business all the time.

408
00:14:58.913 --> 00:15:00.580
If he keeps getting on my case,

409
00:15:00.581 --> 00:15:02.382
I'm gonna explode,
sooner or later.

410
00:15:02.383 --> 00:15:04.684
It sucks. You [bleep]
make the best of it.

411
00:15:04.685 --> 00:15:06.219
It's not funny.
This is not funny.

412
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.720
We lost.

413
00:15:07.721 --> 00:15:09.923
Whoo!

414
00:15:09.924 --> 00:15:11.424
Whoo!

415
00:15:11.425 --> 00:15:13.159
Yes! This is awesome!

416
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.095
We get to take in gorgeous views
of this gorgeous island.

417
00:15:16.096 --> 00:15:17.297
Sweet!

418
00:15:17.298 --> 00:15:20.233
Oh, my God!
[Laughter]

419
00:15:20.234 --> 00:15:21.768
All right, you ready?
Yes.

420
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:23.536
I am totally psyched.

421
00:15:23.537 --> 00:15:25.605
Zip-lining is something
I've always wanted to do.

422
00:15:25.606 --> 00:15:27.640
On three.
One, two, three.

423
00:15:27.641 --> 00:15:29.475
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

424
00:15:29.476 --> 00:15:31.945
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

425
00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:40.753
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

426
00:15:40.754 --> 00:15:45.525
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

427
00:15:45.526 --> 00:15:47.994
I'm hanging probably,
I want to say,

428
00:15:47.995 --> 00:15:50.730
11,000, 12,000 feet in the air.

429
00:15:50.731 --> 00:15:52.198
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

430
00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:53.800
Is someone coming to save me?

431
00:15:53.801 --> 00:15:56.569
Is there gonna be a helicopter?
I don't know.

432
00:15:56.570 --> 00:15:59.339
We love you, Roshni.

433
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.041
[Laughter]

434
00:16:02.042 --> 00:16:03.977
We're glad you made it safer.

435
00:16:03.978 --> 00:16:06.179
Today was beautiful, just
to hang out with each other

436
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.381
and to bond like that.
I mean, it's priceless.

437
00:16:08.382 --> 00:16:10.717
[All cheering]

438
00:16:16.156 --> 00:16:18.124
Hi, guys.
Hi, guys.

439
00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:20.093
What's up, ladies?

440
00:16:20.094 --> 00:16:21.728
Wow, somebody got a lot of sun.

441
00:16:21.729 --> 00:16:23.963
You gonna be all right?
It was amazing.

442
00:16:23.964 --> 00:16:26.599
I'm mad, I'm angry,
and truthfully,

443
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.735
I wouldn't mind
getting sunburned.

444
00:16:28.736 --> 00:16:29.936
Let's go!

445
00:16:29.937 --> 00:16:31.604
This is getting old, guys.

446
00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:34.207
It's getting old quick.

447
00:16:37.211 --> 00:16:40.113
(Announcer) With the second
dinner service just hours away...

448
00:16:40.114 --> 00:16:41.481
New day. New day.

449
00:16:41.482 --> 00:16:42.548
(Announcer)
Both teams are desperate

450
00:16:42.549 --> 00:16:44.017
to prove themselves.

451
00:16:44.018 --> 00:16:46.185
But while the men have
put their differences aside...

452
00:16:46.186 --> 00:16:49.022
Bang it out.
(Announcer) And are uniting as a team...

453
00:16:49.023 --> 00:16:53.626
The women...
Oh, she gets under my skin so bad.

454
00:16:53.627 --> 00:16:55.561
(Announcer) Are taking a
slightly different approach.

455
00:16:55.562 --> 00:16:56.429
Barbie, did you get tape?

456
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:57.730
Um, I have a little bit.

457
00:16:57.731 --> 00:16:59.432
Do you have enough
for me to use?

458
00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:00.833
Not really, but here.

459
00:17:00.834 --> 00:17:04.003
Take it.

460
00:17:04.004 --> 00:17:05.805
I'm not gonna argue
about [bleep] tape.

461
00:17:05.806 --> 00:17:07.407
I'm not arguing.
Do you want the tape,

462
00:17:07.408 --> 00:17:09.342
or do you not want
the tape, Robyn?

463
00:17:09.343 --> 00:17:11.244
Barbie's just pressing
my buttons.

464
00:17:11.245 --> 00:17:13.746
She's not a team player.
She's here for herself.

465
00:17:13.747 --> 00:17:15.248
We gotta watch our tones.

466
00:17:15.249 --> 00:17:16.716
'Cause I know I can be
aggressive too.

467
00:17:16.717 --> 00:17:18.985
I don't have a tone.
Stop.

468
00:17:18.986 --> 00:17:21.054
Don't tell me to stop.
It's her.

469
00:17:21.055 --> 00:17:22.555
This girl is lucky that

470
00:17:22.556 --> 00:17:24.023
we're not in the [bleep] hood
right now.

471
00:17:24.024 --> 00:17:26.359
I swear to God she's lucky.

472
00:17:31.392 --> 00:17:33.960
(Announcer) While both teams are
hoping to impress chef Ramsay

473
00:17:33.961 --> 00:17:34.728
with tonight's
dinner service...

474
00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:35.929
Now I'm feeling good.

475
00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:37.898
(Announcer)
The red team has the start

476
00:17:37.899 --> 00:17:39.833
of a feud brewing
between Robyn and Barbie.

477
00:17:39.834 --> 00:17:41.067
We gotta watch our tones.

478
00:17:41.068 --> 00:17:42.969
I don't have a tone.

479
00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:45.138
(Christina) There's definitely
some tension building right now.

480
00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:46.940
But we have to stick together.

481
00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.842
We might have a brawl tonight
in the dorms,

482
00:17:48.843 --> 00:17:50.177
but we'll leave it
for after service.

483
00:17:50.178 --> 00:17:51.978
Blue's got their headbands on.
They're all like...

484
00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:53.747
They're ready.
They're ready, dude.

485
00:17:53.748 --> 00:17:54.748
They're sick
of getting defeated.

486
00:17:54.749 --> 00:17:55.415
We gotta be on point.

487
00:17:55.416 --> 00:17:56.516
Let's go, guys!

488
00:17:56.517 --> 00:17:58.618
Chef Ramsay's here.
Let's go.

489
00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:03.056
Opening night was
a huge disappointment, right?

490
00:18:03.057 --> 00:18:04.758
(All) Yes, chef.

491
00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:06.893
Tonight is about redemption.
It's about pride, right?

492
00:18:06.894 --> 00:18:09.262
You can't be happy watching
those customers leave.

493
00:18:09.263 --> 00:18:10.730
Not even being fed.

494
00:18:10.731 --> 00:18:12.132
Tonight is about pride.
What's it about?

495
00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:13.233
(All) Pride!

496
00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:15.202
Let's go.
Okay, James.

497
00:18:15.203 --> 00:18:16.636
Let's go open Hell's Kitchen,
please, let's go.

498
00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:19.706
Yes, chef.

499
00:18:30.885 --> 00:18:32.219
All right, let's go, guys.
Yes?

500
00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:33.353
(All) Yes, chef.

501
00:18:33.354 --> 00:18:34.688
(Announcer)
In addition to the regular

502
00:18:34.689 --> 00:18:35.956
Hell's Kitchen menu...

503
00:18:35.957 --> 00:18:38.992
I'm gonna get the Caesar salad.
The risotto, please.

504
00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.927
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay has added

505
00:18:40.928 --> 00:18:42.529
a special tableside appetizer
of shrimp scampi.

506
00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.997
Okay, first order.

507
00:18:43.998 --> 00:18:46.266
Two scampi tableside.
Two pieces, all right?

508
00:18:46.267 --> 00:18:47.901
(Announcer) Handling tableside service
for the red team will be Christina.

509
00:18:47.902 --> 00:18:49.603
Let's get started.

510
00:18:49.604 --> 00:18:51.838
(Announcer) And for the blue
team, it will be Brian.

511
00:18:51.839 --> 00:18:53.707
Is this table 21 right here?

512
00:18:53.708 --> 00:18:55.108
Table ten?

513
00:18:55.109 --> 00:18:56.877
Ten? Thank you.
I don't have the right table.

514
00:18:56.878 --> 00:18:58.011
I will be back though.
Okay.

515
00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:59.145
[Bleep]

516
00:18:59.146 --> 00:19:00.947
[Whistling]

517
00:19:00.948 --> 00:19:02.249
Pizza's in, yes?

518
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:03.884
Yes, chef.
Thank you, let's go.

519
00:19:03.885 --> 00:19:05.552
I gotta the get
the [bleep] pizza dough.

520
00:19:05.553 --> 00:19:06.853
You got a pizza dough
right here.

521
00:19:06.854 --> 00:19:08.188
Stop slowing down.

522
00:19:08.189 --> 00:19:10.757
Don't finger the pizza.

523
00:19:10.758 --> 00:19:12.325
The man is intimidating.

524
00:19:12.326 --> 00:19:13.760
(Gordon) I'm waiting
on the pizza.

525
00:19:13.761 --> 00:19:15.295
Okay, yes, chef.
I'm moving.

526
00:19:15.296 --> 00:19:18.265
Just his aura
is very nerve-racking.

527
00:19:18.266 --> 00:19:20.400
(Gordon) Hurry up, bozo.

528
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:21.701
And I'm anxious...

529
00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:23.136
You got it.
Confidence, confidence.

530
00:19:23.137 --> 00:19:25.105
Petrified, terrified, excited.

531
00:19:25.106 --> 00:19:27.073
Let's go, Donald.
Coming out.

532
00:19:27.074 --> 00:19:28.742
It's like an ocean of emotion.

533
00:19:28.743 --> 00:19:30.343
Pizza, chef.

534
00:19:30.344 --> 00:19:35.649
On the pass.

535
00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.284
Don, I've got burnt pizza
on the top...

536
00:19:37.285 --> 00:19:38.385
Yeah?
And raw underneath.

537
00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:40.320
Burnt and raw.

538
00:19:40.321 --> 00:19:42.122
How the [bleep] you managed
that one, I don't know.

539
00:19:42.123 --> 00:19:43.690
Oh, my God.

540
00:19:43.691 --> 00:19:48.061
Look, oh, hey, hello.
Raw and burnt.

541
00:19:48.062 --> 00:19:49.062
[Bleep]

542
00:19:49.063 --> 00:19:52.532
What a dumbass.

543
00:19:52.533 --> 00:19:55.035
He can't make a little,
seven-inch pizza.

544
00:19:55.036 --> 00:19:56.036
It's ridiculous.

545
00:19:56.037 --> 00:19:57.737
Donald?
Yes, sir?

546
00:19:57.738 --> 00:19:59.005
We can't go down on a pizza.
Let's go.

547
00:19:59.006 --> 00:20:00.340
Yes, chef.

548
00:20:00.341 --> 00:20:02.709
(Announcer) While don
starts over on the pizza,

549
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:06.112
in the red kitchen, Kimmie
is ready with her first pizza.

550
00:20:06.113 --> 00:20:08.415
Very nice.
Very nice indeed.

551
00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.116
(Announcer)
But to complete the order,

552
00:20:10.117 --> 00:20:11.651
chef Ramsay needs
one more item.

553
00:20:11.652 --> 00:20:14.020
risotto's how long?
Here, chef.

554
00:20:14.021 --> 00:20:15.622
I know how to cook risotto.

555
00:20:15.623 --> 00:20:17.023
It's one of my
favorite dishes to make.

556
00:20:17.024 --> 00:20:19.426
All I wanna hear is,
"ding, ding, ding.

557
00:20:19.427 --> 00:20:21.861
Service please.
Service please."

558
00:20:24.265 --> 00:20:26.967
(Gordon) All of you, come here.

559
00:20:26.968 --> 00:20:28.802
Three risottos
on the same table.

560
00:20:28.803 --> 00:20:32.439
A light one, a dark one,
and a medium one.

561
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:35.909
The same [bleep]ing table.

562
00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:37.911
[Groans] Dagger in the heart.

563
00:20:37.912 --> 00:20:39.012
[Bleep].

564
00:20:39.013 --> 00:20:40.080
Who's in charge
of the appetizers?

565
00:20:40.081 --> 00:20:41.615
I am, chef.

566
00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:43.550
So you don't put them into one
pan and finish them together?

567
00:20:43.551 --> 00:20:44.951
I should have.

568
00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:46.486
You cook them all the way,
one minute to go.

569
00:20:46.487 --> 00:20:47.554
Put them into one big pan.

570
00:20:47.555 --> 00:20:48.588
[Bleep] me.

571
00:20:48.589 --> 00:20:51.358
I'm like, Briana!

572
00:20:51.359 --> 00:20:53.927
Do something.
Sh-she wasn't doing anything.

573
00:20:53.928 --> 00:20:54.995
Go!

574
00:20:54.996 --> 00:20:56.963
Hurry up!
Get everyone that.

575
00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:58.365
That one was served
in three different colors.

576
00:20:58.366 --> 00:20:59.332
Yes, chef.

577
00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:00.767
Oh, my God.

578
00:21:00.768 --> 00:21:02.636
(Announcer)
With chef Ramsay rejecting

579
00:21:02.637 --> 00:21:03.970
the women's first attempt
at risotto...

580
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.839
Make another one.
Make another one.

581
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.807
(Announcer) Over in
the blue kitchen, one chef...

582
00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:09.843
How are we doing on that?

583
00:21:09.844 --> 00:21:11.778
(Announcer) Is determined to make
his first appetizer perfect.

584
00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:12.846
First risotto.

585
00:21:12.847 --> 00:21:15.215
All right.
I'm following.

586
00:21:15.216 --> 00:21:17.117
There is no [bleep]ing way
that anything that I send

587
00:21:17.118 --> 00:21:19.819
is gonna come back to me.

588
00:21:24.358 --> 00:21:25.959
Who made that risotto?

589
00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.293
I did.

590
00:21:27.294 --> 00:21:28.962
Delicious.
Thank you, chef.

591
00:21:28.963 --> 00:21:30.563
[Bleep].
Hey, good job, Guy.

592
00:21:30.564 --> 00:21:32.065
Let's keep on going.
It's nothing.

593
00:21:32.066 --> 00:21:34.801
I didn't do nothing.
It feels so good.

594
00:21:34.802 --> 00:21:36.636
Whoo!

595
00:21:36.637 --> 00:21:38.838
Second pizza, chef.

596
00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:40.173
Service, please.

597
00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:41.708
(Announcer)
After a bumpy start,

598
00:21:41.709 --> 00:21:44.644
the men, led by Guy,
are now on a roll.

599
00:21:44.645 --> 00:21:46.046
Two risotto, two Caesar salad.

600
00:21:46.047 --> 00:21:47.747
Right now, turning the pass.

601
00:21:47.748 --> 00:21:49.315
(Announcer) And appetizers, whether
they be from the kitchen...

602
00:21:49.316 --> 00:21:50.183
Service, please.

603
00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:51.418
(Announcer)
Or the dining room...

604
00:21:51.419 --> 00:21:52.686
(Brian) Fun, no?

605
00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:54.154
(Announcer) Are quickly
making their way to diners.

606
00:21:54.155 --> 00:21:55.221
That's raw.

607
00:21:55.222 --> 00:21:57.157
(Announcer) But maybe
a little too quickly.

608
00:21:57.158 --> 00:21:59.159
I do apologize.

609
00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.761
Made by idiots.
I do apologize.

610
00:22:01.762 --> 00:22:03.697
I'll see what I can do.
Okay.

611
00:22:03.698 --> 00:22:07.967
They're all raw.

612
00:22:07.968 --> 00:22:10.203
All of you, stop.

613
00:22:10.204 --> 00:22:13.073
(Gordon) Brian, stop!

614
00:22:13.074 --> 00:22:14.641
All of a sudden I hear...

615
00:22:14.642 --> 00:22:16.176
The voice.

616
00:22:16.177 --> 00:22:17.911
It's urgent!
Yes, chef.

617
00:22:17.912 --> 00:22:20.046
He's not calling me downstairs

618
00:22:20.047 --> 00:22:23.249
to tell me that
my dish was great.

619
00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.086
Raw and overcooked
on the same [bleep]ing table.

620
00:22:26.087 --> 00:22:28.188
Raw and overcooked.

621
00:22:28.189 --> 00:22:32.225
Start again.
Yes, chef.

622
00:22:32.226 --> 00:22:34.694
(Announcer) 45 minutes into
dinner service, the red team

623
00:22:34.695 --> 00:22:37.030
has yet to serve
a single appetizer.

624
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:38.932
Where's the risotto?
risotto.

625
00:22:38.933 --> 00:22:40.467
Pizza, please, Kimmie.

626
00:22:40.468 --> 00:22:42.368
(Announcer)
The women are relying

627
00:22:42.369 --> 00:22:45.105
on their star performer
from the scallop challenge,

628
00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:46.840
Barbie,
to complete their first order.

629
00:22:46.841 --> 00:22:48.808
Scallops, how long?
Scallops, how long?

630
00:22:48.809 --> 00:22:51.444
Two scallops coming up
to the pass, chef.

631
00:22:51.445 --> 00:22:53.079
Are we missing pieces?
No.

632
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.848
(Tiffany) I thought
it was five pieces.

633
00:22:54.849 --> 00:22:56.516
There are supposed
to be five per order,

634
00:22:56.517 --> 00:22:57.550
and I looked at the bitch,

635
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:58.651
and she [bleep]ing
hands me eight scallops.

636
00:22:58.652 --> 00:23:00.153
Chef, scallops right here.

637
00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:01.788
(Tiffany) Here you go, Barbie.

638
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:03.056
I'll just throw you
under the bus

639
00:23:03.057 --> 00:23:03.823
'cause that's where you belong.

640
00:23:03.824 --> 00:23:05.225
I'm missing two.

641
00:23:05.226 --> 00:23:07.660
Two scallops.

642
00:23:07.661 --> 00:23:09.729
Two times five is what?
Ten, chef.

643
00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.464
And you gave me eight scallops.
Yes, chef.

644
00:23:11.465 --> 00:23:13.399
What's the matter with you?

645
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.168
(Gordon) Okay, everybody.
Two scallops away.

646
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:16.970
Two times five is ten.

647
00:23:16.971 --> 00:23:18.538
Barbie gives me eight scallops.

648
00:23:18.539 --> 00:23:19.873
We're waiting for two more.

649
00:23:19.874 --> 00:23:21.574
That's the state
of the concentration

650
00:23:21.575 --> 00:23:24.210
going on currently
in this kitchen.

651
00:23:24.211 --> 00:23:25.945
Do you even know how to count?

652
00:23:25.946 --> 00:23:28.481
Ten.
Ten scallops.

653
00:23:28.482 --> 00:23:30.784
Coming out, coming out,
coming out, coming out.

654
00:23:30.785 --> 00:23:33.820
Go with that.
Please [bleep] off.

655
00:23:33.821 --> 00:23:35.789
(Announcer) Barbie's scallops
finally add up to success

656
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:37.190
for the red team.

657
00:23:37.191 --> 00:23:38.958
Service, please.

658
00:23:38.959 --> 00:23:40.593
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
in the blue kitchen...

659
00:23:40.594 --> 00:23:41.194
Four scallops, one risotto.

660
00:23:41.195 --> 00:23:42.695
Yes, chef.

661
00:23:42.696 --> 00:23:45.331
(Announcer) Chris has his own
math problem to solve.

662
00:23:45.332 --> 00:23:48.835
Four orders scallops.
That's 20 pieces.

663
00:23:48.836 --> 00:23:49.969
I got you, man.

664
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:51.604
I know I had four orders.

665
00:23:51.605 --> 00:23:53.072
That's 20 pieces of scallops.

666
00:23:53.073 --> 00:23:54.507
I'm like, all right, cool.

667
00:23:54.508 --> 00:23:55.508
I don't know if I should do it

668
00:23:55.509 --> 00:23:57.043
in four orders in two pans,

669
00:23:57.044 --> 00:23:58.812
or if I should just go
with four orders in four pans.

670
00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:00.847
And I'm contemplating...
I'm like,

671
00:24:00.848 --> 00:24:04.484
if I get two larger pans,
I could bang out two orders...

672
00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:07.020
and I could bang out
four orders in two pans.

673
00:24:07.021 --> 00:24:09.889
I'm just, like,
completely freaking out.

674
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.457
Chris, how long
on those scallops?

675
00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:12.358
Scallops, ten seconds.

676
00:24:12.359 --> 00:24:13.693
Come on, get them
out of the pan,

677
00:24:13.694 --> 00:24:16.262
get them out of the pan.

678
00:24:16.263 --> 00:24:21.734
Put them right up there.

679
00:24:21.735 --> 00:24:26.973
[Bleep]
Now, you are killing me.

680
00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:29.175
All of you. All of you!
How dare you?

681
00:24:29.176 --> 00:24:31.077
Did you learn anything
yesterday?

682
00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:32.278
(Gordon) I mean, come on.

683
00:24:32.279 --> 00:24:35.014
[Grunts]

684
00:24:41.221 --> 00:24:43.377
(Announcer) After the men
spent most of yesterday

685
00:24:43.378 --> 00:24:44.534
working with scallops,

686
00:24:44.535 --> 00:24:47.737
chef Ramsay expected
perfection from the blue team.

687
00:24:47.738 --> 00:24:49.806
All of you.
All of you!

688
00:24:49.807 --> 00:24:51.508
(Announcer)
But what he got instead...

689
00:24:51.509 --> 00:24:53.209
This is where it really hurts.

690
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.979
(Announcer) Was overcooked
scallops from Chris.

691
00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.614
Touch those [bleep]ing
scallops.

692
00:24:57.615 --> 00:24:58.982
(Gordon) How...
[bleep] dare you?

693
00:24:58.983 --> 00:25:01.518
How dare you?

694
00:25:01.519 --> 00:25:02.986
All of you, go over there.

695
00:25:02.987 --> 00:25:04.287
Take a [bleep] [bleep],
and eat it.

696
00:25:04.288 --> 00:25:05.722
Just see what
we're about to send out.

697
00:25:05.723 --> 00:25:07.057
[Bleep] you.

698
00:25:07.058 --> 00:25:09.426
All of you, let's go.
Have a snack.

699
00:25:09.427 --> 00:25:10.960
My fat ass sat
in a pile of snow,

700
00:25:10.961 --> 00:25:12.429
picking up scallops,

701
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.364
and now I'm sitting there
like a [bleep],

702
00:25:14.365 --> 00:25:16.232
eating these things 'cause
you can't pan-sear a scallop?

703
00:25:16.233 --> 00:25:17.967
What are you,
[bleep]ing kidding me?

704
00:25:17.968 --> 00:25:18.968
No one leaves
until they [bleep]ing eat them.

705
00:25:18.969 --> 00:25:20.470
And if they don't eat them,

706
00:25:20.471 --> 00:25:21.471
[bleep] off home.
I've had enough.

707
00:25:21.472 --> 00:25:22.272
Yes, chef.

708
00:25:22.273 --> 00:25:23.606
Anybody else?
Come on.

709
00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:24.774
I've got six in my mouth.

710
00:25:24.775 --> 00:25:27.243
[Burps]

711
00:25:27.244 --> 00:25:29.446
(Announcer) While the
men try to regroup...

712
00:25:29.447 --> 00:25:30.814
I need four scallop pigeon
risottos still, yeah?

713
00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:32.082
Yes, chef.

714
00:25:32.083 --> 00:25:33.416
(Announcer)
Over in the red kitchen...

715
00:25:33.417 --> 00:25:34.417
Come on, ladies.

716
00:25:34.418 --> 00:25:36.386
Coming up with the scallops,
chef.

717
00:25:36.387 --> 00:25:38.755
(Announcer) Barbie looks to keep
the momentum going on appetizers.

718
00:25:38.756 --> 00:25:41.758
No, no, she can't [bleep]ing
tell me that's [bleep]ing done.

719
00:25:41.759 --> 00:25:43.226
All of you, come here.

720
00:25:43.227 --> 00:25:45.128
You, put the pan down.
Yes, chef.

721
00:25:45.129 --> 00:25:47.297
You've just given me
two portions.

722
00:25:47.298 --> 00:25:48.298
Look at this!

723
00:25:48.299 --> 00:25:50.834
L-l...
just look...

724
00:25:50.835 --> 00:25:52.035
Touch them, everybody.

725
00:25:52.036 --> 00:25:53.536
They're all burnt.

726
00:25:53.537 --> 00:25:55.004
Just cook it right.

727
00:25:55.005 --> 00:25:56.873
Like, you just sank us.

728
00:25:56.874 --> 00:25:58.508
Are you with us now?
Yes, chef.

729
00:25:58.509 --> 00:25:59.409
Or are you back
in Catalina Island?

730
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:00.677
I'm with us.

731
00:26:00.678 --> 00:26:01.978
Get off the zip-line,
and get back down to earth.

732
00:26:01.979 --> 00:26:03.113
Yes, chef.

733
00:26:03.114 --> 00:26:04.748
Whenever Barbie
touches anything,

734
00:26:04.749 --> 00:26:05.949
it's, like, a disaster.

735
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.817
She makes me crazy.

736
00:26:07.818 --> 00:26:12.288
(Announcer) While chef Ramsay gives
Barbie another chance on scallops,

737
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:14.390
he had drawn a line in the sand
with the blue team.

738
00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:15.859
God help anybody

739
00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.193
if something's wrong
on this next ticket.

740
00:26:17.194 --> 00:26:19.462
God help them.

741
00:26:19.463 --> 00:26:22.365
We cannot [bleep] up scallops
over and over again.

742
00:26:22.366 --> 00:26:24.100
It's embarrassing.
It's ridiculous.

743
00:26:24.101 --> 00:26:25.502
Coming at you in two minutes,
chef.

744
00:26:25.503 --> 00:26:27.337
I gotta get over there
and help them out.

745
00:26:27.338 --> 00:26:28.538
Look at that [bleep].
Get another one.

746
00:26:28.539 --> 00:26:29.973
We going like this.
Get those out of the pan.

747
00:26:29.974 --> 00:26:32.375
Oh, my God.

748
00:26:32.376 --> 00:26:35.845
One, two, three, four, five,
six of you cooking scallops.

749
00:26:35.846 --> 00:26:38.114
There's more [bleep]ing
chefs cooking scallops

750
00:26:38.115 --> 00:26:39.983
than there are scallops
in the pot.

751
00:26:39.984 --> 00:26:43.653
Guys, have you any idea
how stupid you look?

752
00:26:43.654 --> 00:26:45.054
Yes, chef.
Yes, chef.

753
00:26:45.055 --> 00:26:47.223
Six chefs,
one for each scallop,

754
00:26:47.224 --> 00:26:49.459
and one to rub their asses.

755
00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.027
(Scott) I need the scallops.

756
00:26:51.028 --> 00:26:55.198
Right now.
I'm walking, chef.

757
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.005
(Gordon) Service, please.

758
00:27:02.006 --> 00:27:04.073
Uh, get a mouthful of this.

759
00:27:04.074 --> 00:27:05.775
I feel like
we got some swagger back.

760
00:27:05.776 --> 00:27:07.410
(Announcer) An hour and a half

761
00:27:07.411 --> 00:27:09.846
and 75 scallops
into dinner service,

762
00:27:09.847 --> 00:27:10.847
the blue kitchen...

763
00:27:10.848 --> 00:27:12.048
On the line.

764
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:13.216
(Announcer)
And the red kitchen...

765
00:27:13.217 --> 00:27:14.784
One scallop coming.

766
00:27:14.785 --> 00:27:16.820
(Announcer) Have just about
completed sending out appetizers.

767
00:27:16.821 --> 00:27:18.121
Very nice.
Service, please.

768
00:27:18.122 --> 00:27:20.023
It's really good.

769
00:27:20.024 --> 00:27:22.058
(Announcer) And are now ready to
go full-speed ahead on entrees.

770
00:27:22.059 --> 00:27:23.493
Entree.
Oh, [bleep].

771
00:27:23.494 --> 00:27:24.527
Two sea bass, two lamb.

772
00:27:24.528 --> 00:27:25.528
Yes, chef.

773
00:27:25.529 --> 00:27:26.896
How long on your sea bass?

774
00:27:26.897 --> 00:27:28.198
W-we're going
on the pass.

775
00:27:28.199 --> 00:27:29.666
All my meat was sitting there,
waiting,

776
00:27:29.667 --> 00:27:31.034
because everything
for it...

777
00:27:31.035 --> 00:27:32.702
order has to come up
at the same time

778
00:27:32.703 --> 00:27:33.703
on the pass to meet together.

779
00:27:33.704 --> 00:27:35.605
How long to the sea bass?

780
00:27:35.606 --> 00:27:37.006
(Barbie) Two minutes.

781
00:27:37.007 --> 00:27:38.274
Two minutes on the pass,

782
00:27:38.275 --> 00:27:39.909
you're walking the sea bass,
correct?

783
00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.579
Two minutes, look...
yes, two [bleep]ing minutes!

784
00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:43.613
You say "yes" then.

785
00:27:43.614 --> 00:27:46.416
Two minutes.

786
00:27:46.417 --> 00:27:47.817
Sea bass ready?

787
00:27:47.818 --> 00:27:50.687
J-just give me...
like, it's fish.

788
00:27:50.688 --> 00:27:52.188
All I'm waiting for
is just, like, a magic time.

789
00:27:52.189 --> 00:27:53.523
I-it's just...

790
00:27:53.524 --> 00:27:55.725
I don't think Barbie
understands what times are.

791
00:27:55.726 --> 00:27:58.728
She wears a watch on her wrist,
but I don't think it works.

792
00:27:58.729 --> 00:28:00.496
Two sea bass, two lamb.

793
00:28:00.497 --> 00:28:02.165
Could someone give me
an accurate time for the fish?

794
00:28:02.166 --> 00:28:06.603
Ah, [bleep] this.

795
00:28:06.604 --> 00:28:08.004
(Robyn) The bass up?

796
00:28:08.005 --> 00:28:09.439
Just walk.
Just walk.

797
00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.408
You gotta talk to me.
You gotta talk to me, Barbie.

798
00:28:12.409 --> 00:28:14.177
I-I-I...
No, you did not.

799
00:28:14.178 --> 00:28:17.947
Okay.
Not the time, guys.

800
00:28:17.948 --> 00:28:20.283
Behind, coming through
the pass with the lamb.

801
00:28:20.284 --> 00:28:22.652
Warm.

802
00:28:22.653 --> 00:28:24.220
[Bleep] you are kidding me.

803
00:28:24.221 --> 00:28:26.155
[Bleep] That's raw.

804
00:28:26.156 --> 00:28:30.093
All of you, come here.

805
00:28:30.094 --> 00:28:31.494
The bass is overcooked.

806
00:28:31.495 --> 00:28:34.631
Watery and overcooked.

807
00:28:34.632 --> 00:28:37.867
And look, lamb undercooked.
Bass overcooked.

808
00:28:37.868 --> 00:28:40.603
Because Barbie's screwing up,
or is it you're following her?

809
00:28:40.604 --> 00:28:42.338
I know how to cook good lamb.

810
00:28:42.339 --> 00:28:43.806
My timing was [bleep],

811
00:28:43.807 --> 00:28:45.141
and who [bleep]
me on the timing?

812
00:28:45.142 --> 00:28:46.910
Thank you, Barbie.
Appreciate it.

813
00:28:46.911 --> 00:28:48.378
All right, let's start again.

814
00:28:48.379 --> 00:28:49.379
(Barbie) Starting again.

815
00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:50.813
L-let's just start again,
ladies.

816
00:28:50.814 --> 00:28:52.081
Why don't we fire, like,
four more [bleep]ing vats

817
00:28:52.082 --> 00:28:53.850
right now too, okay?

818
00:28:53.851 --> 00:28:56.119
Let's pick it up and get
this food out, okay, guys?

819
00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.221
(Announcer) While the women start
over on their first entrees,

820
00:28:58.222 --> 00:29:01.257
in the blue kitchen, Chris
is hoping to redeem himself

821
00:29:01.258 --> 00:29:02.358
on the fish station.

822
00:29:02.359 --> 00:29:03.993
Four minutes, yes.

823
00:29:03.994 --> 00:29:05.828
It's not the way you start.
It's the way you finish.

824
00:29:05.829 --> 00:29:07.897
I gotta push, I gotta push,
I gotta push.

825
00:29:07.898 --> 00:29:11.434
Just gather all the pieces,
put myself back on the map.

826
00:29:11.435 --> 00:29:12.835
Two Wellington...
For how long?

827
00:29:12.836 --> 00:29:13.703
Coming up now, chef.

828
00:29:13.704 --> 00:29:14.704
Coming down, coming down.

829
00:29:14.705 --> 00:29:15.772
Where's the...

830
00:29:15.773 --> 00:29:18.775
Right behind.

831
00:29:18.776 --> 00:29:20.476
[Bleep]

832
00:29:20.477 --> 00:29:24.647
That's raw.
Stone [bleep]ing cold.

833
00:29:24.648 --> 00:29:27.050
All of you, come here.

834
00:29:27.051 --> 00:29:28.051
You especially.

835
00:29:28.052 --> 00:29:29.385
Just touch that.

836
00:29:29.386 --> 00:29:30.787
Cold, touch that.
Yeah, look.

837
00:29:30.788 --> 00:29:33.056
T-t...
it's stone cold.

838
00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:34.390
[Grunts]

839
00:29:34.391 --> 00:29:36.059
[Bleep]
Who cooked the Wellington?

840
00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.527
I did, chef.

841
00:29:37.528 --> 00:29:39.529
'Cause it cooked perfectly.
Take them back now.

842
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.030
I can give you another one
in 30 seconds, chef.

843
00:29:41.031 --> 00:29:42.031
Chris, you ready?

844
00:29:42.032 --> 00:29:43.032
Yeah.

845
00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:44.600
Royce, got the garnish?

846
00:29:44.601 --> 00:29:46.035
Bring him the garnish.
Come on, Royce.

847
00:29:46.036 --> 00:29:47.403
Got two Wellingtons
and no garnish.

848
00:29:47.404 --> 00:29:48.705
One minute on garnish.

849
00:29:48.706 --> 00:29:50.098
All right, take it easy.
Get it hot.

850
00:29:50.099 --> 00:29:53.276
Royce gets so [bleep] nervous.
He's like a little girl.

851
00:29:53.277 --> 00:29:55.044
[Bleep], dude,
you guys aren't communicating.

852
00:29:55.045 --> 00:29:57.714
Bland. It's bland. It's bland.

853
00:29:57.715 --> 00:29:58.715
[Indistinct]

854
00:29:58.716 --> 00:30:00.216
Yes, chef.

855
00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:02.719
Butter, cream.
Look, it's black.

856
00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.053
[Bleep] you see?

857
00:30:04.054 --> 00:30:05.488
My God, work it!

858
00:30:05.489 --> 00:30:06.990
(Royce) Chef Ramsay...

859
00:30:06.991 --> 00:30:09.492
I wanna say
I'm sorry I, uh...

860
00:30:09.493 --> 00:30:11.594
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

861
00:30:11.595 --> 00:30:15.331
I didn't know how you wanted
your mashed potatoes.

862
00:30:17.434 --> 00:30:19.902
I don't know how to
wake you up anymore.

863
00:30:19.903 --> 00:30:21.437
You're like a zombie!
Sorry, chef.

864
00:30:21.438 --> 00:30:23.973
You make him look [bleep] good!

865
00:30:23.974 --> 00:30:26.275
(Announcer)
Two hours into dinner service,

866
00:30:26.276 --> 00:30:28.945
and not a single entree
has left either kitchen.

867
00:30:28.946 --> 00:30:31.414
Patience is wearing thin
in the dining room.

868
00:30:31.415 --> 00:30:33.282
I do apologize.

869
00:30:33.283 --> 00:30:35.785
(Announcer) And the red
kitchen is crumbling quickly.

870
00:30:35.786 --> 00:30:38.187
How long on the bass?
Two minutes, tops.

871
00:30:38.188 --> 00:30:40.356
A real [bleep] two minutes,
or a playful two minutes?

872
00:30:40.357 --> 00:30:41.624
Coming through.
Pardon me, chef.

873
00:30:41.625 --> 00:30:43.393
40 seconds on...

874
00:30:43.394 --> 00:30:46.796
I've got six bass going.
Where...

875
00:30:46.797 --> 00:30:48.564
Chef, I told them
to start the bass, because...

876
00:30:48.565 --> 00:30:49.999
Six?
Yes.

877
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.301
It's supposed to be cooked
to order! It's fish!

878
00:30:52.302 --> 00:30:53.903
Coming down with scallops.

879
00:30:53.904 --> 00:30:55.905
I don't understand why
I'm getting yelled at.

880
00:30:55.906 --> 00:30:57.306
I'm trying to [bleep]
put out food for the customer.

881
00:30:57.307 --> 00:30:59.042
I mean, I'm pissed off
that he's mad at me.

882
00:30:59.043 --> 00:31:00.943
Ladies... stop!

883
00:31:00.944 --> 00:31:03.780
All of you come here.

884
00:31:03.781 --> 00:31:06.182
You're telling her
to cook six bass

885
00:31:06.183 --> 00:31:08.618
for three tables in front
of what we're doing.

886
00:31:08.619 --> 00:31:10.853
And then this arrives.

887
00:31:10.854 --> 00:31:12.121
We're screwed.

888
00:31:12.122 --> 00:31:13.356
(Gordon)
For the seventh time...

889
00:31:13.357 --> 00:31:18.127
Touch them. Touch them.

890
00:31:18.128 --> 00:31:20.129
All of you... Get out!

891
00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:21.798
Hey, you.
Take that with you.

892
00:31:21.799 --> 00:31:23.499
Get out of my [bleep] sight.

893
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.202
Get out! Out!

894
00:31:26.203 --> 00:31:27.703
God! Oh, my God.

895
00:31:27.704 --> 00:31:29.839
Absolutely useless.

896
00:31:32.376 --> 00:31:34.710
Holy [bleep].

897
00:31:34.711 --> 00:31:36.045
[Bleep].

898
00:31:36.046 --> 00:31:37.980
"I got fish. I got fish."
You cocky bitch.

899
00:31:37.981 --> 00:31:39.148
Don't ever call me
a [bleep] bitch again.

900
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:40.249
You understand?

901
00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:42.752
Barbie's the reason why
we went down tonight.

902
00:31:42.753 --> 00:31:44.287
I don't know why
she's [bleep] here.

903
00:31:44.288 --> 00:31:45.188
The two fish that had to go...

904
00:31:45.189 --> 00:31:51.194
[Prolonged cursing]

905
00:31:51.195 --> 00:31:52.962
What is wrong with you?

906
00:31:57.469 --> 00:31:58.771
(Announcer)
Two hours into the second

907
00:31:58.772 --> 00:31:59.706
dinner service
in Hell's Kitchen...

908
00:31:59.707 --> 00:32:00.640
Get out!

909
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:03.076
(Announcer) And the red team
has been kicked out.

910
00:32:03.077 --> 00:32:04.510
"I got fish, I got fish."
You cocky bitch.

911
00:32:04.511 --> 00:32:06.212
(Announcer)
And the lack of harmony

912
00:32:06.213 --> 00:32:08.348
in the kitchen has
now exploded in the dorm.

913
00:32:08.349 --> 00:32:10.350
[Bleep]!
Get the [bleep]!

914
00:32:10.351 --> 00:32:11.684
You [bleep] idiot!

915
00:32:11.685 --> 00:32:13.119
What is wrong with you?

916
00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.588
Bitch, stop.

917
00:32:15.589 --> 00:32:18.191
(Announcer) Meanwhile,
back in the blue kitchen...

918
00:32:18.192 --> 00:32:19.859
Oven op...
oven open.

919
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:21.160
(Announcer) The men bring
their third attempt...

920
00:32:21.161 --> 00:32:22.495
We're going sirloin?

921
00:32:22.496 --> 00:32:24.230
(Announcer)
At the first entrees

922
00:32:24.231 --> 00:32:25.665
to chef Ramsay for approval.

923
00:32:25.666 --> 00:32:28.101
All of you, come here.

924
00:32:28.102 --> 00:32:30.103
What is that?

925
00:32:31.672 --> 00:32:34.807
I'm opening
a steakhouse in Vegas.

926
00:32:34.808 --> 00:32:36.409
Take that.

927
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:37.443
Yes, chef.

928
00:32:37.444 --> 00:32:38.978
[Bleep] off, all of you.

929
00:32:38.979 --> 00:32:40.413
Get out.

930
00:32:40.414 --> 00:32:41.581
Get out.

931
00:32:41.582 --> 00:32:42.582
Get out.

932
00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:44.851
Terrible.

933
00:32:44.852 --> 00:32:46.386
Just give us another shot.

934
00:32:46.387 --> 00:32:47.854
That's all I want us
to do, is just...

935
00:32:47.855 --> 00:32:50.423
Need one more shot.

936
00:32:50.424 --> 00:32:51.758
I do apologize.

937
00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:53.326
There's nothing else
being served tonight.

938
00:32:53.327 --> 00:32:54.694
The blue kitchen
has been closed.

939
00:32:54.695 --> 00:32:57.600
So please... Thank you very,
very much for coming in.

940
00:33:01.335 --> 00:33:03.970
What a bizarre,
strange evening.

941
00:33:03.971 --> 00:33:06.806
Ridiculous!

942
00:33:06.807 --> 00:33:09.642
Embarrassing!

943
00:33:09.643 --> 00:33:10.810
Scallops.

944
00:33:10.811 --> 00:33:13.045
The dish where I expected

945
00:33:13.046 --> 00:33:17.784
not one little problem
anywhere, from both kitchens,

946
00:33:17.785 --> 00:33:20.686
I got a meltdown.

947
00:33:20.687 --> 00:33:24.457
Tonight clearly
the losing team is...

948
00:33:27.694 --> 00:33:30.530
The women...

949
00:33:30.531 --> 00:33:32.698
And the men.

950
00:33:32.699 --> 00:33:37.937
A sinking ship
and a runaway train.

951
00:33:37.938 --> 00:33:40.406
Each team,
come up with two individuals

952
00:33:40.407 --> 00:33:43.443
that you don't want
in your team any longer.

953
00:33:43.444 --> 00:33:46.112
Do something properly
and all together

954
00:33:46.113 --> 00:33:48.047
for the first time tonight.

955
00:33:48.048 --> 00:33:50.016
[Bleep] off, all of you.

956
00:33:50.017 --> 00:33:54.320
(Don) I don't know how things
got so crazy and out of hand.

957
00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:55.888
It was just...
[Mimics explosion]

958
00:33:55.889 --> 00:33:58.591
We couldn't
cook [bleep] scallops.

959
00:33:58.592 --> 00:34:01.327
We got served a scallop
[Bleep] milkshake yesterday,

960
00:34:01.328 --> 00:34:02.795
and we [bleep] scallops up.

961
00:34:02.796 --> 00:34:04.297
I got to say, Chris,

962
00:34:04.298 --> 00:34:05.932
you [bleep] me with th...
with the fish.

963
00:34:05.933 --> 00:34:08.568
I totally [bleep] that
first [lndistinct] of scallops.

964
00:34:08.569 --> 00:34:10.036
There's no excuse for it.

965
00:34:10.037 --> 00:34:12.271
Chef really has high standards,
but it's a [bleep] scallop.

966
00:34:12.272 --> 00:34:13.840
I'm going to man up.

967
00:34:13.841 --> 00:34:15.708
I'm going to take
responsibility for my actions.

968
00:34:15.709 --> 00:34:18.411
My first nomination
is for myself.

969
00:34:18.412 --> 00:34:20.146
I should've asked for help.

970
00:34:20.147 --> 00:34:23.382
I sh... didn't and...
I collapsed on it.

971
00:34:23.383 --> 00:34:25.451
(Announcer) The blue team's
first nominee comes easy.

972
00:34:25.452 --> 00:34:27.487
Chris made it
unanimous for himself.

973
00:34:27.488 --> 00:34:29.322
(Announcer) And it looks like

974
00:34:29.323 --> 00:34:30.857
it'll be an easy decision
for the red team...

975
00:34:30.858 --> 00:34:32.325
The first nomination
is going to be Barbie.

976
00:34:32.326 --> 00:34:34.060
Yes.
(Announcer) As well.

977
00:34:34.061 --> 00:34:37.396
All I wanted to do was to see
this dinner service finished.

978
00:34:37.397 --> 00:34:38.564
You [bleep] idiot.

979
00:34:38.565 --> 00:34:41.634
Like, go the [bleep] home.

980
00:34:41.635 --> 00:34:43.336
Nobody wants
your bitch ass here.

981
00:34:43.337 --> 00:34:45.037
I [bleep] it up.
I'm going up there.

982
00:34:45.038 --> 00:34:46.706
You done brought
the Memphis out of me, ho.

983
00:34:46.707 --> 00:34:48.608
You [bleep] it up,
I swear to God...

984
00:34:48.609 --> 00:34:50.443
We already have one nominee,

985
00:34:50.444 --> 00:34:52.178
is that what you're saying?
Yes, we already have one.

986
00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:53.546
Yes, so now we're
only voting on the second.

987
00:34:53.547 --> 00:34:55.181
I'll go against you, dawg.
Stop.

988
00:34:55.182 --> 00:34:56.983
Put me up against her.
We need to decide on two.

989
00:34:56.984 --> 00:34:58.417
So give me a [bleep] paper.

990
00:34:58.418 --> 00:34:59.785
We all want Barbie to go home.

991
00:34:59.786 --> 00:35:01.254
Tiffany, come talk to me.

992
00:35:01.255 --> 00:35:02.555
However, we have to pick
two people

993
00:35:02.556 --> 00:35:04.290
to put up for elimination.

994
00:35:04.291 --> 00:35:06.225
I don't feel that
anything happened tonight

995
00:35:06.226 --> 00:35:09.795
to anybody to warrant them
going home, besides Barbie.

996
00:35:09.796 --> 00:35:11.831
I am going to nominate
Roshni tonight because

997
00:35:11.832 --> 00:35:13.833
I don't think
she's going to get sent home,

998
00:35:13.834 --> 00:35:16.502
so if I vote for Roshni,
then I think chef

999
00:35:16.503 --> 00:35:18.204
will definitely
get rid of Barbie next.

1000
00:35:18.205 --> 00:35:19.872
I agree with you.
It makes sense.

1001
00:35:19.873 --> 00:35:21.874
I'm totally in.

1002
00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:23.743
Rosh, I want to tell you
right now, like,

1003
00:35:23.744 --> 00:35:25.878
I voted for you,
and it's nothing personal.

1004
00:35:25.879 --> 00:35:27.513
And I don't think
you'll go home.

1005
00:35:27.514 --> 00:35:29.315
Based on tonight's service,

1006
00:35:29.316 --> 00:35:30.750
I don't deserve to be
up on that chopping block,

1007
00:35:30.751 --> 00:35:32.118
and I don't think that
that's fair.

1008
00:35:32.119 --> 00:35:34.654
That's not what chef
asked us to do.

1009
00:35:34.655 --> 00:35:36.556
We've got to come
to a decision.

1010
00:35:36.557 --> 00:35:40.927
I... Don, you didn't
come through with the pizzas.

1011
00:35:40.928 --> 00:35:43.496
That [bleep] station is hard.

1012
00:35:43.497 --> 00:35:46.465
Chef Ramsey said,
who's your weakest link?

1013
00:35:46.466 --> 00:35:48.134
I felt Don was my weakest link.

1014
00:35:48.135 --> 00:35:49.435
You know,
that's my personal feeling.

1015
00:35:49.436 --> 00:35:50.903
Everyone's pointing
the blame at Don.

1016
00:35:50.904 --> 00:35:53.773
But I think Don overall
had a better service tonight

1017
00:35:53.774 --> 00:35:57.677
than both myself and you.

1018
00:35:57.678 --> 00:36:00.246
If you guys believe
that I'm the weakest link,

1019
00:36:00.247 --> 00:36:01.380
then vote me up.

1020
00:36:01.381 --> 00:36:02.848
And I'll defend my honor.

1021
00:36:02.849 --> 00:36:04.984
I didn't waste the money
for scallops.

1022
00:36:04.985 --> 00:36:07.119
I didn't waste the time
for pizza.

1023
00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:10.222
I never seen what

1024
00:36:10.223 --> 00:36:13.059
the mashed potatoes
[bleep] looked like here.

1025
00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:16.162
Really? 30 years old,
all the experience,

1026
00:36:16.163 --> 00:36:18.464
somebody has to show you
how to make mashed potato?

1027
00:36:18.465 --> 00:36:19.632
Come on, man.

1028
00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:21.467
For me, the weakest link

1029
00:36:21.468 --> 00:36:22.835
is the person that cannot
man up for his [bleep].

1030
00:36:22.836 --> 00:36:24.203
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1031
00:36:24.204 --> 00:36:25.571
When did I not man up, though?

1032
00:36:25.572 --> 00:36:27.873
Now!
You're not manning up.

1033
00:36:27.874 --> 00:36:29.775
This is so [bleep] unfair.

1034
00:36:29.776 --> 00:36:31.711
This is so [bleep] unfair
that I'm in this position again.

1035
00:36:31.712 --> 00:36:33.713
I am torn.
I gotta be honest with you.

1036
00:36:36.416 --> 00:36:39.151
We got to get rid of her!
That's what I said.

1037
00:36:39.152 --> 00:36:41.587
Barbie is going home.

1038
00:36:41.588 --> 00:36:43.522
Bye bye!

1039
00:36:43.523 --> 00:36:44.824
Au revoir.

1040
00:36:44.825 --> 00:36:48.828
Write me a [bleep] postcard.

1041
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:50.196
Teams, have you
reached a decision?

1042
00:36:50.197 --> 00:36:51.497
(All) Yes, chef.

1043
00:36:51.498 --> 00:36:52.832
Dana.
Yes, chef?

1044
00:36:52.833 --> 00:36:54.634
First nominee and why, please.

1045
00:36:54.635 --> 00:36:58.404
Our first nominee tonight
is Barbie,

1046
00:36:58.405 --> 00:37:01.707
because we feel she is
not a team player, chef.

1047
00:37:01.708 --> 00:37:03.709
Second nominee.

1048
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:07.480
Our second nominee tonight,
chef, is Roshni.

1049
00:37:07.481 --> 00:37:09.048
Roshni?
Yes, chef.

1050
00:37:09.049 --> 00:37:12.918
Okay, so you think
that these two

1051
00:37:12.919 --> 00:37:15.054
are the worst chefs
in your brigade?

1052
00:37:15.055 --> 00:37:18.691
Yes, chef.
Thank you.

1053
00:37:18.692 --> 00:37:21.127
Blue team, have you come
to a consensus?

1054
00:37:21.128 --> 00:37:22.561
(All) Yes, chef.

1055
00:37:22.562 --> 00:37:24.730
Guy, first nominee
and why, please.

1056
00:37:24.731 --> 00:37:27.199
First nominee is Chris,

1057
00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.567
based on performance
on the fish station.

1058
00:37:28.568 --> 00:37:29.802
Chris.
Yes.

1059
00:37:29.803 --> 00:37:34.407
And the second nominee...

1060
00:37:38.552 --> 00:37:40.320
(Announcer) The red team
has nominated

1061
00:37:40.321 --> 00:37:42.388
Barbie and Roshni
for elimination.

1062
00:37:42.389 --> 00:37:44.224
As for the blue team,

1063
00:37:44.225 --> 00:37:46.025
the men unanimously
nominated Chris.

1064
00:37:46.026 --> 00:37:47.727
And now they must give
chef Ramsay

1065
00:37:47.728 --> 00:37:49.462
their second selection.

1066
00:37:49.463 --> 00:37:53.166
The second nominee is...

1067
00:37:53.167 --> 00:37:56.703
Royce...

1068
00:37:56.704 --> 00:38:01.207
Based on the performance
on garnish station.

1069
00:38:01.208 --> 00:38:03.710
Barbie, Roshni, Chris,

1070
00:38:03.711 --> 00:38:06.212
Royce, step forward please.
Let's go.

1071
00:38:07.948 --> 00:38:10.316
Unbelievable.

1072
00:38:10.317 --> 00:38:11.818
Let's start off with Roshni.

1073
00:38:11.819 --> 00:38:13.853
I'm a strong chef,
I'm passionate.

1074
00:38:13.854 --> 00:38:15.488
I don't know, chef,
why I'm up here.

1075
00:38:15.489 --> 00:38:16.956
What?

1076
00:38:16.957 --> 00:38:18.524
We had to come up
with two nominees.

1077
00:38:18.525 --> 00:38:19.959
And that was the reason why.

1078
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.928
Dana, does this make sense?

1079
00:38:21.929 --> 00:38:23.463
We could not come
to a consensus

1080
00:38:23.464 --> 00:38:25.565
on who else should be voted,

1081
00:38:25.566 --> 00:38:27.000
based on tonight's service.

1082
00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:29.869
Really?
Everybody on this team

1083
00:38:29.870 --> 00:38:31.771
unanimously voted for Barbie
as our first vote.

1084
00:38:31.772 --> 00:38:34.107
Yes.

1085
00:38:34.108 --> 00:38:35.909
Barbie.
Yes, chef?

1086
00:38:35.910 --> 00:38:37.443
Tell me why you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen.

1087
00:38:37.444 --> 00:38:39.045
I made some mistakes.

1088
00:38:39.046 --> 00:38:41.214
I do not plan on making
those same mistakes again.

1089
00:38:41.215 --> 00:38:43.216
So who is the worst
in the red team, then?

1090
00:38:43.217 --> 00:38:45.885
Robyn and Kimmie, chef.

1091
00:38:45.886 --> 00:38:47.620
What did Kimmie
do wrong tonight?

1092
00:38:47.621 --> 00:38:49.289
Kimmie brings down morale.
She does.

1093
00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.625
What?
Are you kidding me?

1094
00:38:52.626 --> 00:38:54.961
For me.

1095
00:38:54.962 --> 00:38:57.297
Barbie is the one who lowers
the morale on this team.

1096
00:38:57.298 --> 00:38:59.899
Oh, my God.

1097
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.668
[Bleep].

1098
00:39:01.669 --> 00:39:05.738
Royce,
you're gaining every minute,

1099
00:39:05.739 --> 00:39:09.242
every hour, every day,
a bad reputation.

1100
00:39:09.243 --> 00:39:12.111
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

1101
00:39:12.112 --> 00:39:15.214
I have all the dedication
and all the knowledge.

1102
00:39:15.215 --> 00:39:17.116
And I'm going to tell you

1103
00:39:17.117 --> 00:39:18.918
to put mashed potatoes
in a large pan

1104
00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:20.486
to incorporate butter and cream

1105
00:39:20.487 --> 00:39:22.322
to make it a little bit sexy.

1106
00:39:22.323 --> 00:39:24.824
I definitely don't think
my performance tonight, though,

1107
00:39:24.825 --> 00:39:27.393
warrants me being
the worst chef on this team.

1108
00:39:27.394 --> 00:39:31.264
I think the gentlemen
behind you feel that way.

1109
00:39:31.265 --> 00:39:34.701
That's why they nominated you.

1110
00:39:34.702 --> 00:39:37.537
Chris, why do you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen?

1111
00:39:37.538 --> 00:39:39.005
I think I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen

1112
00:39:39.006 --> 00:39:40.773
'cause I'm a strong cook.

1113
00:39:40.774 --> 00:39:43.409
I have passion,
I have desire to be here.

1114
00:39:43.410 --> 00:39:44.844
No, seriously, chef.

1115
00:39:44.845 --> 00:39:47.280
I [bleep] It up
on the scallops, I did.

1116
00:39:47.281 --> 00:39:48.481
I was frazzled.

1117
00:39:48.482 --> 00:39:50.383
And I just got...
[Bleep] Up,

1118
00:39:50.384 --> 00:39:52.285
and I was in quicksand.
I just kept sinking and sinking,

1119
00:39:52.286 --> 00:39:53.753
I couldn't get my head
out of it.

1120
00:39:53.754 --> 00:39:57.357
I'm deeply sorry
that a non-stick pan

1121
00:39:57.358 --> 00:40:00.259
and three scallops
frazzled your mind.

1122
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:04.964
Okay.

1123
00:40:04.965 --> 00:40:09.202
My decision is...

1124
00:40:09.203 --> 00:40:13.406
Roshni, Royce,

1125
00:40:13.407 --> 00:40:15.842
back in line, both of you.

1126
00:40:21.115 --> 00:40:25.051
Now I face
a very difficult decision.

1127
00:40:25.052 --> 00:40:28.988
Truthfully, you both
should be going home.

1128
00:40:28.989 --> 00:40:32.492
My decision is...

1129
00:40:32.493 --> 00:40:36.963
Barbie.

1130
00:40:36.964 --> 00:40:42.435
Back in line.

1131
00:40:42.436 --> 00:40:47.206
Chris, give me
your jacket please.

1132
00:40:47.207 --> 00:40:49.442
If your mind is frazzled

1133
00:40:49.443 --> 00:40:51.310
at this stage of the game,

1134
00:40:51.311 --> 00:40:53.212
there's no way on earth
you're going to Vegas, big boy.

1135
00:40:53.213 --> 00:40:54.447
Yes, chef.
Thank you.

1136
00:40:54.448 --> 00:40:57.283
Good night.
I appreciate it.

1137
00:41:01.622 --> 00:41:03.623
Hell's Kitchen is brutal.

1138
00:41:03.624 --> 00:41:04.924
It's tough.

1139
00:41:04.925 --> 00:41:07.193
Chef Ramsay's intimidating,
you know?

1140
00:41:07.194 --> 00:41:09.195
And... I just cracked
under the pressure.

1141
00:41:09.196 --> 00:41:11.030
Wake up.

1142
00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:12.665
Big time.

1143
00:41:12.666 --> 00:41:13.666
Listen carefully.

1144
00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:15.401
Tomorrow morning,

1145
00:41:15.402 --> 00:41:19.739
I have a very, very
big surprise for all of you.

1146
00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:20.973
Now piss off.

1147
00:41:20.974 --> 00:41:22.208
Thanks, chef.

1148
00:41:22.209 --> 00:41:24.944
What?
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

1149
00:41:24.945 --> 00:41:27.280
You're bringing the devil
back on our team?

1150
00:41:27.281 --> 00:41:32.151
We're all going to make
Barbie's life hell.

1151
00:41:32.152 --> 00:41:33.753
This is not a good thing
for the blue team.

1152
00:41:33.754 --> 00:41:35.855
I'm tired of losing.

1153
00:41:35.856 --> 00:41:37.590
I would like to win
a dinner service.

1154
00:41:37.591 --> 00:41:38.925
I would like
to win a challenge.

1155
00:41:38.926 --> 00:41:41.727
You know, go outside
and see a flower.

1156
00:41:41.728 --> 00:41:43.763
I'm not giving up.

1157
00:41:43.764 --> 00:41:45.298
In the end,
there's only going to be

1158
00:41:45.299 --> 00:41:46.065
one of us left standing.

1159
00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:47.900
And guess what?

1160
00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:49.635
It's going to be me.

1161
00:41:49.636 --> 00:41:52.505
I'm sure that Chris prays

1162
00:41:52.506 --> 00:41:54.173
that he never sees
another scallop.

1163
00:41:54.174 --> 00:41:55.475
And after tonight,

1164
00:41:55.476 --> 00:41:58.010
I pray I don't see anymore
of him.

1165
00:42:01.949 --> 00:42:04.383
(Announcer) Next time,
on Hell's Kitchen...

1166
00:42:04.384 --> 00:42:05.685
Barbie may have survived
elimination...

1167
00:42:05.686 --> 00:42:07.053
Back in line.

1168
00:42:07.054 --> 00:42:08.454
Barbie's still here.

1169
00:42:08.455 --> 00:42:09.622
It's so annoying.

1170
00:42:09.623 --> 00:42:11.090
I'm not going home tonight.

1171
00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:11.891
(Announcer)
But will she survive...

1172
00:42:11.892 --> 00:42:13.092
I'll [bleep]...

1173
00:42:13.093 --> 00:42:14.727
And you're gonna
be going [bleep] home.

1174
00:42:14.728 --> 00:42:16.529
(Announcer)
...The night?

1175
00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.030
Somebody needs to tell
the [bleep] bitch what's up.

1176
00:42:18.031 --> 00:42:19.699
You want to get
[bleep] choked out?

1177
00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.601
You want to get [bleep]
choked out, you dumb [bleep]?

1178
00:42:21.602 --> 00:42:24.203
I'm shaking in my boots.

1179
00:42:24.204 --> 00:42:25.738
(Announcer) And when
the blue team's

1180
00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:26.906
dinner service...
Awful.

1181
00:42:26.907 --> 00:42:28.374
(Announcer) Erupts in chaos...

1182
00:42:28.375 --> 00:42:29.642
I can't sink any further.

1183
00:42:29.643 --> 00:42:31.511
Why is it so difficult?

1184
00:42:31.512 --> 00:42:33.713
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay
takes drastic measures.

1185
00:42:33.714 --> 00:42:35.081
Oh, Royce, two seconds please.

1186
00:42:35.082 --> 00:42:36.182
I know who he's calling.

1187
00:42:36.183 --> 00:42:37.383
(Announcer)
And you won't believe...

1188
00:42:37.384 --> 00:42:38.884
And I'm like
"oh, [bleep]."

1189
00:42:38.885 --> 00:42:40.311
(Announcer)
Who he gets on the phone.

1190
00:42:40.312 --> 00:42:41.433
Royce?

1191
00:42:41.434 --> 00:42:43.294
(Announcer)
Find out who survives

1192
00:42:43.295 --> 00:42:44.295
[Bleep] idiot.

1193
00:42:44.296 --> 00:42:46.155
(Announcer) Next time
What are you doing?

1194
00:42:46.156 --> 00:42:48.283
(Announcer) On an intense...
Brutal!

1195
00:42:48.284 --> 00:42:49.610
(Announcer) Explosive...

1196
00:42:50.409 --> 00:42:52.242
(Announcer) Combative...

1197
00:42:52.243 --> 00:42:53.637
(Announcer) Hell's Kitchen.

1198
00:42:53.638 --> 00:42:55.192
Pathetic!
